<h1>The Best Movies According to Htein Lin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>This movie is so good that can't even express the things that include in it.</p>


<h3>Your lie in april</h3>
<p>This movie is also one of the most precious movies ever. Eventhough it has a sad ending, the best part is the sound of its piano and violin.It attract me to watch that again and again.</p>


<h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>This movie has the most heart breaking script ever. Doctor Strange has done a lot of important things like saving the world and fighting with the villain. He helps the people who really need so they can stay peacefully. But the world give him only the suffering. He loses his girlfriend that he loves so much. She married to the other guy and Doctor Stange went to her wedding and he even said to stay happy. What a heart breaking moment! I can even tell how much he will feel sad at that time with a smiling face. But he still uses his life to the fullest by doing the best things that he can do and helps other people. How braveful he is!  </p>
